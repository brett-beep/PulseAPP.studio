**Welcome to your Base44 project** 

**About**

View and Edit  your app on [Base44.com](http://Base44.com) 

This project contains everything you need to run your app locally.

**Edit the code in your local development environment**

Any change pushed to the repo will also be reflected in the Base44 Builder.

**Syncing Base44 changes back to local**

Base44 sync is Git-based: pushing from local updates Base44. To get changes you made in the Base44 dashboard (entities, automations, secrets) into your local repo: use **Pull** in your Git client if Base44 is connected to GitHub and pushes to your repo, or re-apply entity/schema changes manually. Data (e.g. records in tables) is managed in the dashboard; export from **Dashboard → Data → More Actions → Export** if you need a local copy.

**Prerequisites:** 

1. Clone the repository using the project's Git URL 
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create an `.env.local` file and set the right environment variables
