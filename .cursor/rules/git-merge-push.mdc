# Git merge and push

When the user asks to **merge and push**, **pull and push**, **sync with remote**, or similar:

1. **Use full permissions**  
   Run the command with `required_permissions: ["all"]` so credential helpers (e.g. macOS Keychain for HTTPS) can run.

2. **Use an explicit merge strategy**  
   Divergent branches require a strategy. Use merge (not rebase) so the operation is non-interactive:

   ```bash
   git pull --no-rebase --no-edit && git push
   ```

Do not use a bare `git pull` (it may prompt for merge vs rebase). Do not assume sandbox + network is enough for git push (HTTPS often needs full permissions for credentials).
